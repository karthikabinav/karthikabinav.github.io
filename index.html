                            I am currently a research scientist at Facebook. Previously, I finished my PhD at the Department of Computer Science at <a href="www.cs.umd.edu" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park</a>
                                (I also received an M.S. degree from the same department).
                                I was fortunate to work closely with <a href="collab.html" target="_blank">these</a> awesome researchers.
                                Even before that, I obtained a B.Tech (Hons), with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Operations Research, from <a href="www.cs.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. My <a href="http://abishek90.github.io/" target="_blank">brother</a> and I spent our childhood days in the beautiful city of Bangalore, India.

								My research interests broadly span the intersection of Algorithms, Machine Learning and Operations Research. I am interested
								in both foundations and applications of problems that broadly fall in these domains. 
                                I am especially interested in research that spans the full spectrum of theory to practice (i.e., theory informing practice and applications informing theory).<br/>
                                
                                My current focus is to design foundational algorithms and tools for robust decision making under uncertainty and apply it in the real-world (recent applications include ride-share and human computation).
                                This encompasses topics in probability, optimization, matching-based market design,
                                online machine learning, causal inference and theoretical computer science. <br/>
                                I am always open to working on projects tied to other application areas (especially those with a human component) which require principled algorithmic approaches.
                                Feel free to contact me! <br/>
                               
                                <br/>
                                Algorithmic decision making is ubiquitous in modern society; it dictates how we travel, what we spend our money, attention and time on, where we eat among others. With algorithms playing such a key role, we want them
                                to work for everybody in every scenario; formally this translates to algorithm receiving inputs from multiple models of the environment and optimizing different objective functions. Often we want the same (or with minimal modifications) 
                                algorithm to be "robust" in the sense that they work with multiple constraints seemlessly; sometimes the algorithm need not even know which of these environments it is working in! 
                                Some aspects of robustness my research focusses on are as follows.  <br/> <br/>
                                
                                <div style="align:left">
                                  <li><u><strong>Realtime v/s Offline Data</u></strong>: Compared to traditional algorithm design, modern applications require algorithms that operate on real-time data.
                                  The input is given as a sequence (possibly adapting to the previous decisions made by the algorithm) and the performance of the algorithm 
                                  is compared against an algorithm that received the entire data at once before making any decisions; we want the performance to comparably good 
                                  (often measured using regret or competitive ratio). Often there are additional constraints 
                                  (e.g., fairness-efficiency tradeoff below, limited supply of goods, avoiding recency bias) which further make the task difficult. 
                                  This class of problems are what is commonly called as online
                                  machine learning. </li> <br/>

                                <li><u><strong>Fairness-Efficiency Tradeoff</u></strong>: The goal is to design the same algorithm that provides the optimal tradeoff between any given fairness metric (e.g., group level fairness)
                                  while also maintaining worst-case global efficiency guarantees. One example of fairness is to ensure that the algorithm does not amplify existing societal biases
                                 in the quest to maximize utility. However, fairness issues can also broadly manifest in other scenarios where we want to provide "equal service for equal requests".
                                </li><br/>

                                <li> <u><strong>Easy v/s Hard inputs</u></strong>: The goal is to design a single algorithm that performs very well when the given environment/instance is "easy" while still
                                  achieving optimal guarantees in the "hard" scenarios. The most common notion of "easy"  and "hard" environments is that the input is obtained as a sample
                                  from a distribution (i.e., i.i.d. assumption in statistical machine learning) in the easy case and that an adaptive adversary who is strategic to the choice the algorithm makes provides the input (i.e., adversarial ML) in the hard case. 
                                  Easy v/s Hard distinction also refers to fine-grained analysis of algorithms for a given modelling of the input (e.g., stochastic or adversarial). 
                                </li><br/>

                                <li> <u><strong>Scarce v/s Infinite Data</u></strong>: The goal is to answer when can machine learning algorithms that are designed with the assumption that we have sufficient data also provably work
                                  well when we have limited data? For example, provable causal inference algorithms assume that we have infinite correlation data at our disposal. While
                                  this assumption might apriori be reasonable in some applications, in some other applications this is far from reality. 
                                  Collecting large enough correlation samples can be expensive, time-consuming and sometimes impossible. Thus, it is important to understand when
                                  algorithms designed for the infinite data regime also work in the face of limited data and/or design new algorithms that work well with limited data.                                 </li> <br/>

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                     Rideshare platforms such as Uber and Lyft dynamically dispatch drivers to match riders' requests.  
                     We model the dispatching process in rideshare as a Markov chain that takes into account the geographic 
                     mobility of both drivers and riders over time. Prior work explores dispatch policies in the limit of 
                     such Markov chains; we characterize when this limit assumption is valid, under a variety of natural 
                     dispatch policies.  We give explicit bounds on convergence in general, and exact (including constants) 
                     convergence rates for special cases.  Then, on simulated and real transit data, we show that our bounds 
                     characterize convergence rates---even when the necessary theoretical assumptions are relaxed. Additionally 
                     these policies compare well against a standard reinforcement learning algorithm which optimizes for profit 
                     without any convergence properties.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      We consider Bandits with Knapsacks (henceforth, BwK), a general model for multi-armed bandits under supply/budget constraints. In particular, a bandit algorithm needs to solve a well-known knapsack
                      problem: find an optimal packing of items into a limited-size knapsack. The BwK problem is a common generalization of numerous motivating examples, which range from dynamic pricing to repeated auctions
                      to dynamic ad allocation to network routing and scheduling. While the prior work on BwK focused on the stochastic version, we pioneer the other extreme in which the outcomes can be chosen adversarially. This
                      is a considerably harder problem, compared to both the stochastic version and the “classic” adversarial bandits, in that regret minimization is no longer feasible. Instead, the objective is to minimize the
                      competitive ratio: the ratio of the benchmark reward to algorithm’s reward. We design an algorithm with competitive ratio O(log T) relative to the best fixed distribution over
                      actions, where T is the time horizon; we also prove a matching lower bound. The key conceptual contribution is a new perspective on the stochastic version of the problem. We suggest a new algorithm
                      for the stochastic version, which builds on the framework of regret minimization in repeated games and admits a substantially simpler analysis compared to prior work. We then analyze this algorithm for the
                      adversarial version, and use it as a subroutine to solve the latter.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    We consider the numerical stability of the parameter recovery problem in Linear Structural
                    Equation Model (LSEM) of causal inference. A long line of work starting from Wright (1920) has focused
                    on understanding which sub-classes of LSEM allow for efficient parameter recovery. Despite decades
                    of study, this question is not yet fully resolved. The goal of this paper is complementary to this line of
                    work; we want to understand the stability of the recovery problem in the cases when efficient recovery is
                    possible. Numerical stability of Pearl’s notion of causality was first studied in Schulman and Srivastava
                    (2016) using the concept of condition number where they provide ill-conditioned examples. In this work,
                    we provide a condition number analysis for the LSEM. First we prove that under a sufficient condition,
                    for a certain sub-class of LSEM that are bow-free (Brito and Pearl (2002)), the parameter recovery is
                    stable. We further prove that randomly chosen input parameters for this family satisfy the condition with a
                    substantial probability. Hence for this family, on a large subset of parameter space, recovery is numerically
                    stable. Next we construct an example of LSEM on four vertices with unbounded condition number. We
                    then corroborate our theoretical findings via simulations as well as real-world experiments for a sociology
                    application. Finally, we provide a general heuristic for estimating the condition number of any LSEM
                    instance.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    Matching markets with historical data are abundant in many applications,
                    e.g., matching candidates to jobs in hiring, workers to tasks in crowdsourcing markets,
                    and jobs to servers in cloud services. In all these applications, a match consumes one
                    or more shared and limited resources and the goal is to best utilize these to maximize
                    a global objective. Additionally, one often has historical data and hence some
                    statistics (usually first-order moments) of the arriving agents (e.g., candidates, 
                    workers, and jobs) can be learnt. To model these scenarios, we propose a unifying
                    framework, called Multi-Budgeted Online Assignment with Known Adversarial Distributions.
                    In this model, we have a set of offline servers with different deadlines and a set
                    of online job types. At each time, a job of type $j$ arrives. Assigning this job
                    to a server $i$ yields a profit w_{i, j} while consuming a_e \in [0, 1]^K quantities
                    of distinct resources. The goal is to design an (online) assignment policy that maximizes
                    the total expected profit without violating the (hard) budget constraint. We propose and
                    theoretically analyze two linear programming (LP) based algorithms which are almost
                    optimal among all LP-based approaches. We also propose several heuristics adapted from
                    our algorithms and compare them to other LP-agnostic algorithms using both synthetic
                    as well as real-time cloud scheduling and public safety datasets. Experimental results
                    show that our proposed algorithms are effective and significantly out-perform the baselines.
                    Moreover, we show empirically the trade-off between fairness and efficiency of our
                    algorithms which does well even on fairness metrics without explicitly optimizing for it.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    Online bipartite matching and allocation models are widely used to analyze and design markets such as Internet advertising,
                    online labor, and crowdsourcing. Traditionally, vertices on one side of the market are fixed and known a priori, while
                    vertices on the other side arrive online and are matched by a central agent to the offline side. The issue of possible conflicts
                    among offline agents emerges in various real scenarios when we need to match each online agent with a set of offline agents.
                    For example, in event-based social networks (e.g., Meetup), offline events conflict for some users since they will be unable
                    to attend mutually-distant events at proximate times; in advertising markets, two competing firms may prefer not to be
                    shown to one user simultaneously; and in online recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon Books), books of the same type
                    conflict with each other in some sense due to the diversity requirement for each online buyer.
                    The conflict nature inherent among certain offline agents raises significant challenges in both modeling and online algorithm
                    design. In this paper, we propose a unifying model, generalizing the conflict models proposed in (She et al., TKDE
                    2016) and (Chen et al., TKDE 16). Our model can capture not only a broad class of conflict constraints on the offline
                    side (which is even allowed to be sensitive to each online agent), but also allows a general arrival pattern for the online
                    side (which is allowed to change over the online phase). We propose an efficient linear programming (LP) based online
                    algorithm and prove theoretically that it has nearly-optimal online performance. Additionally, we propose two LP-based
                    heuristics and test them against two natural baselines on both real and synthetic datasets. Our LP-based heuristics experimentally
                    dominate the baseline algorithms, aligning with our theoretical predictions and supporting our unified approach.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    In bipartite matching problems, vertices on one side of a bipartite graph are paired with those on the other. 
                    In its online variant, one side of the graph is available offline, while vertices on the other arrive online 
                    and are irrevocably and immediately matched (or ignored) by an algorithm. Examples of such problems include 
                    matching workers to firms, advertisers to keywords, organs to patients, and so on. Much of the literature focuses 
                    on maximizing the total relevance modeled via total weight of the matching. However, in many real-world problems, 
                    it is also important to consider contributions of diversity: hiring a diverse pool of candidates, displaying a relevant 
                    but diverse set of ads, and so on. In this paper, we propose the Online Submodular Bipartite Matching (OSBM) problem, 
                    where the goal is to maximize a submodular function f over the set of matched edges. This objective is general enough 
                    to capture the notion of both diversity (e.g., a weighted coverage function) and relevance (e.g., the traditional linear 
                    function) as well as many other natural objective functions occurring in practice (e.g., limited total budget in 
                    advertising settings). We propose novel algorithms that have provable guarantees and are essentially optimal when 
                    restricted to various special cases. We also run experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets to validate our 
                    algorithms.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    Efficient allocation of tasks to workers is a central problem in crowdsourcing. In a typical setting, different workers arrive at different times.
                    Similarly, different tasks arrive at different times. The goal is to assign the available workers to tasks, such that we are able to complete as many
                    tasks as possible. Usually, the tasks are heterogeneous and have different rewards. Hence, we would like to maximize the total reward (as opposed to just
                    the number of completed tasks). Often, the arrival times of worker "types" and task "types" are not erratic and can be predicted from historical data.
                    In this paper, we model the problem to account for this history and propose a new mathematical model, called Online Matching with Two-Sided Arrival (OM-TSA).
                    We have a known bipartite graph G = (U,V,E) where U is the set of worker types and V is the set of task types. An edge e = (u, v) exists iff worker u is compatible
                    with task v. The setting proceeds in rounds for T time-steps. At each time-step, a worker u from U and a task v from V are sampled independently from two
                    respective (known) distributions. Further, we assume the sampling processes are independent and identical across the T rounds. We assume that
                    (1) when a worker u arrives, they stay in the sys- tem until matched and (2) when a task v arrives, it needs to be assigned to an available worker u
                    immediately (and obtaining a reward w(u, v)); if not, we do not get any reward for this task (and the action is irrevocable). Our goal is to maximize the
                    expected reward. Our model is a significant generalization of the classical online matching model, where one of the sets U and V , say U, is assumed to be
                    available offline. We relax this assumption to capture the transient nature of worker arrivals. For the general version of OM-TSA, we present an optimal
                    non-adaptive algorithm which achieves an online competitive ratio of 0.295. For the special case of OM-TSA where the reward is a function of just the worker type,
                    we present an improved algorithm (which is adaptive) and achieves a competitive ratio of at least 0.345. On the hardness side, along with showing that the ratio
                    obtained by our non-adaptive algorithm is the best possible among all non-adaptive algorithms, we further show that no (adaptive) algorithm can achieve a ratio better
                    than 0.581 (unconditionally), even for the special case of OM-TSA with homogenous tasks (i.e., all rewards are same). At the heart of our analysis lies a new technical
                    tool (which is a refined notion of the birth-death process) called the two-stage birth-death process, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we perform
                    numerical experiments on both simulated as well as two real-world datasets obtained from crowdsourcing platforms to complement our theoretical results.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    This paper unifies two lines of work on multi-armed bandits, Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) and semi-bandits. 
                    The former concerns scenarios with limited "resources" consumed by the algorithm, e.g., limited inventory in a dynamic pricing problem.
                    The latter has a huge number of actions, but there is combinatorial structure and additional feedback which makes the problem tractable.
                    Both lines of work has received considerable recent attention, and are supported by numerous application examples.
                    We define a common generalization, and design a general algorithm for this model. Our regret rates are comparable with those for BwK and semi-bandits
                    in general, and essentially optimal for important special cases.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    Bipartite matching markets pair agents on one side of a market with agents, items, or contracts on the opposing side. Prior work addresses online bipartite matching
                    markets, where agents arrive over time and are dynamically matched to a known set of disposable resources. In this paper, we propose a new model, Online
                    Matching with (offline) Reusable Resources under Known Adversarial Distributions (OM-RR-KAD), in which resources on the offline side are reusable instead of
                    disposable; that is, once matched, resources become available again at some point in the future. We show that our model is tractable by presenting an LP-based
                    adaptive algorithm that achieves an online competitive ratio of 1/2 − ε for any given ε > 0. We also show that no non-adaptive algorithm can achieve a ratio of
                    1/2 + o(1) based on the same benchmark LP. Through a data-driven analysis on a massive openly-available dataset, we show our model is robust enough to capture
                    the application of taxi dispatching service. We also present heuristics that perform well in practice.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    Column-sparse packing problems arise in several contexts in both deterministic and stochastic discrete optimization.
                    We present two unifying ideas, (non-uniform) attenuation and multiple-chance algorithms, to obtain improved approximation algorithms
                    for some well-known families of such problems. As three main examples, we attain the integrality gap, up to lower-order terms,
                    for known LP relaxations for k-column sparse packing integer programs (Bansal et al., Theory of Computing, 2012)
                    and stochastic k-set packing (Bansal et al., Algorithmica, 2012), and go “half the remaining distance” to optimal for a major
                    integrality-gap conjecture of Furedi, Kahn and Seymour on hypergraph matching (Combinatorica, 1993).

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Online Stochastic Matching with Timeouts problem introduced by Bansal, Gupta, Li, Mestre, Nagarajan, and Rudra (Algorithmica, 2012) models
                    matching markets (e.g. E-Bay, Amazon). Buyers arrive from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) known distribution
                    on buyer profiles and can be shown a list of items one at a time. Each buyer has some probability of purchasing each item and a limit
                    (timeout) on the number of items they can be shown. Bansal et al. (Algorithmica, 2012) gave a 0.12-competitive algorithm
                    which was improved by Adamczyk, Grandoni, and Mukherjee (ESA, 2015) to 0.24. We present an online attenuation framework
                    that uses an algorithm for offline stochastic matching as a black box. Our main contributions are as follows. On the upper bound side, we
                    show that this framework combined with a black box adapted from Bansal et al. (Algorithmica, 2012) yields an online algorithm which
                    nearly doubles the ratio to 0.46. On the lower bound side, we show that no algorithm can achieve a ratio better than 0.632 using the
                    common LP for this problem. We then introduce a natural generalization: Online Stochastic Matching with Two-sided Timeouts in which both
                    online and offline vertices have timeouts. Our framework provides the first algorithm for this problem achieving a ratio of 0.31. We
                    accomplish this by proposing a new black box algorithm for offline stochastic matching on star graphs, which may be of independent
                    interest. This new black box improves the approximation ratio for the offline stochastic matching problem on star graphs from 0.5 by
                    Adamczyk et al. (ESA 2015) to 0.56. <br/><br/>

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    We develop algorithms with improved competitive ratios for some basic variants of the known i.i.d. arrival model with integral arrival rates,
                    including (a) the case of general weighted edges, where we improve the best-known ratio of 0.667 due to Haeupler, Mirrokni and Zadimoghaddam to 0.705 and
                    (b) the vertex-weighted case, where we improve the 0.7250 ratio of Jaillet and Lu to 0.7299. 
                    We also consider two extensions, one is known I.I.D. with non-integral arrival rate and stochastic rewards.
                    The other is known I.I.D. b-matching with non-integral arrival rate and stochastic rewards. 
                    We present a simple non-adaptive algorithm which works well simultaneously on the two extensions.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    With the proliferation of mobile devices, Location-Based Services (LBS) that provide networked services based on users’ locations have become increasingly popular.
                    Such services, providing personalized and timely information, have raised privacy concerns such as unwanted revelation of users’ current locations to potential stalkers.
                    In this work, we show that this problem can be formally (for first time) addressed using the notion of opacity in discrete event systems. We use non-deterministic
                    finite-state automata to capture the mobility patterns of users and label the transitions by the location information in the queries. Using opacity verification techniques,
                    we show that the technique of sending cloaking queries to the server can still reveal the exact location of the user. 
                    To enforce location privacy, we apply the opacity enforcement technique by event insertion. Specifically, we synthesize suitable insertion functions
                    that insert fake queries into the cloaking query sequences. The generated fake queries are always consistent with the mobility model of the user and
                    provably ensure privacy of the user’s current location. Finally, to minimize the overhead from fake queries, we design an optimal insertion
                    function that introduces minimum average number of fake queries.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      The goal of this paper is to study why stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is efficient for neural networks, and how neural net design affects SGD.
                      In particular, we investigate how overparameterization -- an increase in the number of parameters beyond the number of training data -- affects the dynamics of SGD.
                      
                      We introduce a simple concept called gradient confusion.  When confusion is high, stochastic gradients produced by different data
                      samples may be negatively correlated, slowing down convergence.

                      But when gradient confusion is low, we show that SGD has better convergence properties than predicted by classical theory.
                      Using theoretical and empirical results, we study how overparameterization affects gradient confusion, and thus the
                      convergence of SGD, on linear models and neural networks. We show that increasing the number of parameters of linear
                      models or increasing the width of neural networks leads to lower gradient confusion, and thus faster
                      and easier model training. We further show how overparameterization by increasing the depth of neural
                      networks results in higher gradient confusion, making deeper models harder to train. Finally, we observe
                      empirically that batch normalization and skip connections reduce gradient confusion, which helps reduce the training
                      burden of deep networks.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                    One of the goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to enable multiple agents to interact, co-ordinate 
                    and compete with each other to realize various goals. Typically, this is achieved via a system which 
                    acts as a mediator to control the agents' behavior via incentives. Such systems are ubiquitous and 
                    include online systems for shopping (e.g., Amazon), ride-sharing (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and Internet 
                    labor markets (e.g., Mechanical Turk). The main algorithmic challenge in such systems is to ensure 
                    that they can operate under a variety of informational constraints such as uncertainty in the input, 
                    committing to actions based on partial information or being unaffected by noisy input. The mathematical 
                    framework used to study such systems are broadly called sequential decision makin} problems where the 
                    algorithm does not receive the entire input at once; it obtains parts of the input by interacting 
                    (also called "actions") with the environment. 

                    In this thesis, we answer the question, under what informational constraints can we design efficient 
                    algorithms for sequential decision making problems. 

                    The first part of the thesis deals with the Online Matching problem. Here, the algorithm deals with 
                    two prominent constraints: uncertainty in the input and choice of actions being restricted by a 
                    combinatorial constraint. We design several new algorithms for many variants of this problem and 
                    provide provable guarantees. We also show their efficacy on the ride-share application using a 
                    real-world dataset. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the Multi-armed bandit problem 
                    with additional informational constraints. In this setting, the algorithm does not receive the 
                    entire input and needs to make decisions based on partial observations. Additionally, the set of 
                    possible actions is controlled by global resource constraints that bind across time. We design 
                    new algorithms for multiple variants of this problem that are worst-case optimal. We provide a 
                    general reduction framework to the classic multi-armed bandits problem without any constraints. 
                    We complement some of the results with preliminary numerical experiments.

								Final project for the Computational Journalism class on Bias in Google's Autocomplete Suggestion. <br/>
								 Along with Daniel Trielli, we studied the bias in auto-complete suggestions of various country specific <br/>
								 domains of Google when searched about entities of other countries. <br/>
								(For example, searching about Pakistan in India-specific Google page).<br/>
								You can find the code used for the experiments <a href="https://github.com/karthikabinav/Computational-Journalism" target="_blank">here</a>.

								Final class project for the Convex Optimization class. <br/>
								Along with Manasij Venkatesh and Aditya Acharya, we looked at sparse representations for speech <br/>
								using Convex Optimization based approximations. In particular, we applied techniques from compressed <br/>
								sensing literature to speech. <br/>
