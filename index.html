          I am currently a research scientist working at Facebook in the domains of Algorithms,
          Machine Learning with applications to Safety and Integrity, Online advertising and Recommender systems.

          Previously, I finished my PhD at the Department of Computer Science
          at <a href="www.cs.umd.edu" target="_blank">University of Maryland,
            College Park</a>
          (I also received an M.S. degree from the same department).
          I was fortunate to work closely with <a href="collab.html" target="_blank">these</a> awesome researchers.
          During this time,
          I have also held positions at Adobe, IBM Almaden Research Center and Microsoft Research, NYC.
          Even before that, I obtained a B.Tech (Hons), with a major in
          Computer Science and a minor in Operations Research, from <a href="www.cs.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian
            Institute of
            Technology, Madras</a>. My <a href="http://abishek90.github.io/" target="_blank">brother</a> and I spent our
          childhood days in the
          beautiful city of Bangalore, India.

          My research interests broadly spans Algorithms, Machine Learning,
          Data Mining and Market Design. I am interested
          in foundations, modelling and applications of problems that broadly fall
          in these domains.
          I am especially interested in research that has the potential to span the full spectrum
          of theory, practice to eventual integration in large scale complex systems.

          <br />
          Apart from research, I also contribute to the academic (in
          theoretical computer science and machine learning) community via
          reviewing/PC service for
          conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, AIStats, ICLR, AAAI, UAI,
          SODA, ... which I find extremely fulfilling and fun to do.<br />

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            In
            this
            work,
            we
            consider
            the
            problem
            of
            robust
            parameter
            estimation
            from
            observational
            data
            in
            the
            context
            of
            linear
            structural
            equation
            models
            (LSEMs).
            LSEMs
            are
            a
            popular
            and
            well-studied
            class
            of
            models
            for
            inferring
            causality
            in
            the
            natural
            and
            social
            sciences.
            One
            of
            the
            main
            problems
            related
            to
            LSEMs
            is
            to
            recover
            the
            model
            parameters
            from
            the
            observational
            data.
            Under
            various
            conditions
            on
            LSEMs
            and
            the
            model
            parameters
            the
            prior
            work
            provides
            efficient
            algorithms
            to
            recover
            the
            parameters.
            However,
            these
            results
            are
            often
            about
            generic
            identifiability.
            In
            practice,
            generic
            identifiability
            is
            not
            sufficient
            and
            we
            need
            robust
            identifiability:
            small
            changes
            in
            the
            observational
            data
            should
            not
            affect
            the
            parameters
            by
            a
            huge
            amount.
            Robust
            identifiability
            has

            recently
            provided
            a
            set
            of
            sufficient
            conditions
            on
            parameters
            under
            which
            robust
            identifiability
            is
            feasible.
            However,
            a
            limitation
            of
            their
            work
            is
            that
            their
            results
            only
            apply
            to
            a
            small
            sub-class
            of
            LSEMs,
            called
            “bow-free
            paths.”
            In
            this
            work,
            we
            significantly
            extend
            their
            work
            along
            multiple
            dimensions.
            First,
            for
            a
            large
            and
            well-studied
            class
            of
            LSEMs,
            namely
            “bow
            free”
            models,
            we
            provide
            a
            sufficient
            condition
            on
            model
            parameters
            under
            which
            robust
            identifiability
            holds,
            thereby
            removing
            the
            restriction
            of
            paths
            required
            by
            prior
            work.
            We
            then
            show
            that
            this
            sufficient
            condition
            holds
            with
            high
            probability
            which
            implies
            that
            for
            a
            large
            set
            of
            parameters
            robust
            identifiability
            holds
            and
            that
            for
            such
            parameters,
            existing
            algorithms
            already
            achieve
            robust
            identifiability.
            Finally,
            we
            validate
            our
            results
            on
            both
            simulated
            and

            datasets.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            ``Bandits with Knapsacks" (BwK) is a general model for multi-armed bandits under supply/budget constraints.
            While worst-case regret bounds for BwK are well-understood, we present three results that go beyond the
            worst-case perspective.
            First, we provide upper and lower bounds which amount to a full characterization for logarithmic,
            instance-dependent regret rates.
            Second, we consider ``simple regret" in BwK, which tracks algorithm's performance in a given round, and
            prove that it is small in all but a few rounds.
            Third, we provide a general template for extensions from bandits to BwK which takes advantage of some known
            helpful structure, and apply this template to combinatorial semi-bandits and linear contextual bandits. Our
            results build on the BwK algorithm from Agrawal & Devanur EC '14, providing new analyses thereof.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            We design decentralized algorithms for regret minimization in two sided matching markets with one-sided
            bandit feedback that significantly improves upon the prior works. First, for general markets, for any
            epsilon > 0, we design an algorithm that achieves a O(log^{1+epsilon}(T)) regret to
            the agent-optimal stable matching, with unknown time horizon T, improving upon the O(log^{2}(T)) regret
            achieved in prior work. Second, we provide the optimal $\Theta(\log(T))$ regret for markets
            satisfying uniqueness consistency -- markets where leaving participants don't alter the original
            stable matching. Previously, $\Theta(\log(T))$ regret was achievable in the much restricted serial
            dictatorship setting, when all arms have the same preference over the agents. We propose a phase based
            algorithm, where
            in each phase, besides deleting the globally communicated dominated arms, the agents locally delete arms
            with which they collide often. This local deletion is pivotal in breaking deadlocks arising from rank
            heterogeneity of agents across arms. We further demonstrate superiority of our algorithm over existing works
            through simulations.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            In this paper, we consider a novel variant
            of the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem,
            MAB with cost subsidy, which models many
            real-life applications where the learning agent
            has to pay to select an arm and is concerned
            about optimizing cumulative costs and rewards. We present two applications, intelligent SMS routing problem
            and ad audience
            optimization problem faced by a number of
            businesses (especially online platforms) and
            show how our problem uniquely captures key
            features of these applications. We show that
            naive generalizations of existing MAB algorithms like Upper Confidence Bound and
            Thompson Sampling do not perform well for
            this problem. We then establish fundamental lower bound on the performance of any online learning algorithm
            for
            this problem, highlighting the hardness of our
            problem in comparison to the classical MAB
            problem (where T is the time horizon and
            K is the number of arms). We also present
            a simple variant of explore-then-commit and
            establish near-optimal regret bounds for this
            algorithm. Lastly, we perform extensive numerical simulations to understand the behavior of a suite of
            algorithms for various instances and recommend a practical guide to
            employ different algorithms.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            We study regret minimization problems
            in a two-sided matching market where
            uniformly valued demand side agents
            (a.k.a. agents) continuously compete
            for getting matched with
            supply side agents (a.k.a. arms) with
            unknown and heterogeneous valuations.
            Such markets
            abstract online matching platforms
            (for e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit) and
            falls within the purview
            of matching bandit models introduced
            in Liu et al. [24]. The uniform
            valuation in the demand
            side admits a unique stable matching
            equilibrium in the system. We design
            the first decentralized
            algorithm - UCB with Decentralized
            Dominant-arm Deletion (UCB-D3), for
            matching bandits
            under uniform valuation that does not
            require any knowledge of reward gaps
            or time horizon,
            and thus partially resolves an open
            question in [24]. UCB-D3 works in
            phases of exponentially
            increasing length. In each phase, an
            agent first deletes dominated arms –
            the arms preferred by
            agents ranked higher than itself.
            Deletion follows dynamic
            explore-exploit using UCB algorithm
            on the remaining arms. Finally, the
            preferred arm is broadcast in a
            decentralized
            fashion to other agents through pure
            exploitation. Comparing the obtained
            reward with respect to the unique
            stable matching, we show
            that UCB-D3 achieves O(log(T)) regret
            in T rounds. We provide a (orderwise)
            matching regret lower-bound

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            The goal of this
            paper is to
            study why
            stochastic
            gradient descent
            (SGD) is
            efficient for
            neural networks,
            and how neural
            net design
            affects SGD.
            In particular,
            we investigate
            how
            overparameterization
            -- an increase
            in the number of
            parameters
            beyond the
            number of
            training data --
            affects the
            dynamics of SGD.
            We introduce a
            simple concept
            called gradient
            confusion. When
            confusion is
            high, stochastic
            gradients
            produced by
            different data
            samples may be
            negatively
            correlated,
            slowing down
            convergence.

            But when
            gradient
            confusion is
            low, we show
            that SGD has
            better
            convergence
            properties than
            predicted by
            classical
            theory.
            Using
            theoretical and
            empirical
            results, we
            study how
            overparameterization
            affects gradient
            confusion, and
            thus the
            convergence of
            SGD, on linear
            models and
            neural networks.
            We show that
            increasing the
            number of
            parameters of
            linear
            models or
            increasing the
            width of neural
            networks leads
            to lower
            gradient
            confusion, and
            thus faster
            and easier model
            training. We
            further show how
            overparameterization
            by increasing
            the depth of
            neural
            networks results
            in higher
            gradient
            confusion,
            making deeper
            models harder to
            train. Finally,
            we observe
            empirically that
            batch
            normalization
            and skip
            connections
            reduce gradient
            confusion, which
            helps reduce the
            training
            burden of deep

            we
            measure

            Simulations

            simple
            matching
            strategy
            can
            increase
            donor
            action
            rate
            by
            $10$-$15\%$;
            a
            pilot

            with
            real

            smaller
            increase
            of
            roughly
            $5\%$.
            While
            overall
            action
            rates
            remain
            low,
            even
            this
            modest
            increase
            among
            donors
            in
            a
            global
            network
            corresponds

            taking
            action
            toward
            donation.
            Further,
            observing

            action
            on
            a

            Our
            initial
            findings

            Prior

            policies.
            We

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            We
            consider
            Bandits
            with
            Knapsacks
            (henceforth,
            BwK),
            a
            general
            model
            for
            multi-armed
            bandits
            under
            supply/budget
            constraints.
            In
            particular,
            a
            bandit
            algorithm
            needs
            to
            solve
            a
            well-known
            knapsack
            problem:
            find
            an
            optimal
            packing
            of
            items
            into
            a
            limited-size
            knapsack.
            The
            BwK
            problem
            is
            a
            common
            generalization
            of
            numerous
            motivating
            examples,
            which
            range
            from
            dynamic
            pricing
            to
            repeated
            auctions
            to
            dynamic
            ad
            allocation
            to
            network
            routing
            and
            scheduling.
            While
            the
            prior
            work
            on
            BwK
            focused
            on
            the
            stochastic
            version,
            we
            pioneer
            the
            other
            extreme
            in
            which
            the
            outcomes
            can
            be
            chosen
            adversarially.
            This
            is
            a
            considerably
            harder
            problem,
            compared
            to
            both
            the
            stochastic
            version
            and
            the
            “classic”
            adversarial
            bandits,
            in
            that
            regret
            minimization
            is
            no
            longer
            feasible.
            Instead,
            the
            objective
            is
            to
            minimize
            the
            competitive
            ratio:
            the
            ratio
            of
            the
            benchmark
            reward
            to
            algorithm’s
            reward.
            We
            design
            an
            algorithm
            with
            competitive
            ratio
            O(log
            T)
            relative
            to
            the
            best
            fixed
            distribution
            over
            actions,
            where
            T
            is
            the
            time
            horizon;
            we
            also
            prove
            a
            matching
            lower
            bound.
            The
            key
            conceptual
            contribution
            is
            a
            new
            perspective
            on
            the
            stochastic
            version
            of
            the
            problem.
            We
            suggest
            a
            new
            algorithm
            for
            the
            stochastic
            version,
            which
            builds
            on
            the
            framework
            of
            regret
            minimization
            in
            repeated
            games
            and
            admits
            a
            substantially
            simpler
            analysis
            compared
            to
            prior
            work.
            We
            then
            analyze
            this
            algorithm
            for
            the
            adversarial
            version,
            and
            use
            it
            as
            a
            subroutine
            to
            solve
            the
            latter.

            Pearl’s
            notion
            of
            causality
            was
            first
            studied
            in
            Schulman
            and
            Srivastava
            (2016)
            using
            the
            concept
            of
            condition
            number
            where
            they
            provide
            ill-conditioned
            examples.
            In
            this
            work,
            we
            provide
            a
            condition
            number
            analysis
            for
            the
            LSEM.
            First
            we
            prove
            that
            under
            a
            sufficient
            condition,

            certain
            sub-class
            of
            LSEM
            that
            are
            bow-free
            (Brito
            and
            Pearl
            (2002)),
            the
            parameter
            recovery
            is
            stable.
            We
            further
            prove
            that
            randomly
            chosen
            input
            parameters
            for
            this
            family
            satisfy
            the
            condition
            with
            a
            substantial
            probability.
            Hence
            for
            this
            family,
            on
            a
            large
            subset
            of
            parameter
            space,
            recovery
            is
            numerically
            stable.
            Next
            we
            construct
            an
            example
            of
            LSEM
            on
            four
            vertices
            with
            unbounded
            condition
            number.
            We
            then
            corroborate
            our
            theoretical
            findings
            via
            simulations
            as
            well

            for
            a
            sociology
            application.
            Finally,
            we
            provide
            a
            general
            heuristic
            for
            estimating
            the
            condition
            number
            of

            Assigning

            The
            goal
            is

            that
            maximizes
            the
            total
            expected
            profit
            without
            violating
            the
            (hard)
            budget
            constraint.
            We
            propose

            based
            algorithms
            which
            are

            among
            all
            LP-based
            approaches.
            We
            also
            propose
            several
            heuristics

            is
            allowed
            to
            change
            over
            the
            online
            phase).
            We
            propose
            an
            efficient
            linear
            programming
            (LP)
            based
            online
            algorithm
            and
            prove
            theoretically
            that
            it
            has
            nearly-optimal
            online
            performance.
            Additionally,
            we
            propose
            two
            LP-based
            heuristics
            and
            test
            them
            against
            two
            natural
            baselines
            on
            both
            real
            and
            synthetic

            Our

            variant,
            one

            Examples

            Much
            of

            weight
            of
            the
            matching.
            However,
            in
            many
            real-world
            problems,
            it
            is
            also
            important
            to
            consider
            contributions
            of
            diversity:

            but
            diverse
            set
            of
            ads,
            and
            so
            on.
            In
            this
            paper,
            we
            propose

            Bipartite

            the
            goal
            is
            to
            maximize

            set
            of
            matched
            edges.
            This
            objective
            is
            general
            enough
            to
            capture

            both

            (e.g.,
            a
            weighted
            coverage
            function)
            and
            relevance
            (e.g.,
            the
            traditional
            linear
            function)
            as
            well
            as
            many
            other
            natural
            objective
            functions
            occurring
            in
            practice
            (e.g.,
            limited
            total
            budget
            in
            advertising
            settings).
            We
            propose
            novel
            algorithms
            that
            have
            provable
            guarantees
            and

            Efficient

            of
            tasks
            to
            workers
            is
            a
            central
            problem
            in
            crowdsourcing.
            In
            a
            typical
            setting,
            different
            workers
            arrive
            at
            different
            times.
            Similarly,
            different

            arrive
            at
            different
            times.
            The
            goal
            is
            to
            assign
            the
            available
            workers
            to
            tasks,

            many
            tasks
            as
            possible.
            Usually,
            the
            tasks
            are
            heterogeneous
            and
            have
            different
            rewards.
            Hence,
            we
            would
            like
            to
            maximize
            the
            total

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            This

            unifies
            two
            lines
            of
            work
            on
            multi-armed
            bandits,
            Bandits
            with
            Knapsacks
            (BwK)
            and
            semi-bandits.
            The
            former
            concerns
            scenarios
            with
            limited
            "resources"
            consumed
            by
            the
            algorithm,
            e.g.,
            limited
            inventory
            in
            a
            dynamic
            pricing
            problem.
            The
            latter
            has
            a
            huge
            number
            of
            actions,
            but
            there
            is
            combinatorial
            structure
            and
            additional
            feedback
            which
            makes
            the
            problem
            tractable.
            Both
            lines
            of

            received
            considerable
            recent
            attention,
            and
            are
            supported
            by
            numerous
            application
            examples.
            We
            define
            a
            common
            generalization,
            and
            design
            a
            general
            algorithm
            for
            this
            model.
            Our
            regret
            rates
            are
            comparable
            with
            those
            for
            BwK
            and
            semi-bandits
            in
            general,
            and
            essentially
            optimal
            for
            important
            special
            cases.

            Our
            framework
            provides
            the

            of
            0.31.
            We
            accomplish
            this

            for
            offline
            stochastic
            matching
            on
            star
            graphs,

            on
            users’
            locations
            have
            become
            increasingly
            popular.
            Such
            services,
            providing
            personalized
            and
            timely
            information,
            have
            raised
            privacy
            concerns
            such
            as
            unwanted
            revelation
            of
            users’
            current
            locations
            to
            potential
            stalkers.
            In
            this
            work,
            we
            show
            that
            this
            problem
            can
            be
            formally
            (for
            first
            time)
            addressed
            using
            the
            notion
            of
            opacity
            in
            discrete
            event
            systems.
            We
            use
            non-deterministic
            finite-state
            automata
            to
            capture
            the
            mobility
            patterns
            of
            users
            and
            label
            the
            transitions
            by
            the
            location
            information
            in
            the
            queries.
            Using
            opacity
            verification
            techniques,
            we
            show
            that
            the
            technique
            of
            sending
            cloaking
            queries
            to
            the
            server
            can
            still
            reveal
            the
            exact
            location
            of
            the
            user.
            To
            enforce
            location
            privacy,
            we
            apply
            the
            opacity
            enforcement
            technique
            by
            event
            insertion.
            Specifically,
            we
            synthesize
            suitable
            insertion
            functions
            that
            insert
            fake
            queries
            into
            the
            cloaking
            query
            sequences.
            The
            generated
            fake
            queries
            are
            always
            consistent
            with
            the
            mobility
            model
            of
            the
            user
            and
            provably
            ensure
            privacy
            of
            the
            user’s
            current
            location.
            Finally,
            to
            minimize
            the
            overhead
            from
            fake
            queries,
            we
            design
            an
            optimal
            insertion
            function
            that
            introduces
            minimum
            average
            number
            of
            fake
            queries.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            We consider the Stochastic Matching problem, which is motivated by applications
            in kidney exchange and online dating. In this problem, we are given an undirected graph. Each
            edge is assigned a known, independent probability of existence and a positive weight (or profit).
            We must probe an edge to discover whether or not it exists. Each node is assigned a positive
            integer called a timeout (or a patience). On this random graph we are executing a process, which
            probes the edges one-by-one and gradually constructs a matching. The process is constrained in
            two ways. First, if a probed edge exists, it must be added irrevocably to the matching (the querycommit
            model). Second, the timeout of a node v upper-bounds the number of edges incident to
            v that can be probed. The goal is to maximize the expected weight of the constructed matching.
            For this problem, Bansal et al. provided a 0.33-approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs
            and a 0.25-approximation for general graphs. We improve the approximation factors to 0.39 and
            0.269, respectively.
            The main technical ingredient in our result is a novel way of probing edges according to a
            notuniformly-random permutation. Patching this method with an algorithm that works best for
            large-probability edges (plus additional ideas) leads to our improved approximation factors.

            can

            The
            first
            part
            of
            the
            thesis
            deals
            with
            the
            Online
            Matching
            problem.
            Here,
            the
            algorithm
            deals
            with
            two
            prominent
            constraints:
            uncertainty
            in
            the
            input
            and
            choice
            of
            actions
            being
            restricted
            by
            a
            combinatorial
            constraint.
            We
            design
            several
            new
            algorithms
            for
            many
            variants
            of
            this
            problem
            and
            provide
            provable
            guarantees.
            We
            also
            show
            their
            efficacy
            on
            the
            ride-share
            application
            using
            a
            real-world
            dataset.
            In

            we
            consider
            the
            Multi-armed
            bandit
            problem
            with
            additional
            informational
            constraints.
            In
            this
            setting,
            the
            algorithm
            does
            not
            receive
            the
            entire
            input
            and
            needs
            to
            make
            decisions
            based
            on
            partial
            observations.
            Additionally,
            the
            set
            of
            possible
            actions
            is
            controlled
            by
            global
            resource
            constraints
            that
            bind
            across
            time.
            We
            design
            new
            algorithms
            for
            multiple
            variants
            of
            this
            problem
            that
            are
            worst-case
            optimal.
            We
            provide
            a
            general
            reduction
            framework
            to

            without
