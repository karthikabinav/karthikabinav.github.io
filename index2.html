<span style="color:green"><strong>Approximate schedule</strong>:</span> 
The approximate schedule thus far is

<h2>Course Goals</h2>
Our primary goals are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Use the standard class-format to:
<ol>
<li>teach the basics of (modern) algorithms, and</li>
<li>use an "inverted classroom" format where students will do some assigned
reading/work at home, with related problem-solving (e.g., HW solutions) 
done in class.</li>
</ol>
<li>Expose the students (in the HWs and in class) to different 
models such as online and distributed
computing, large data-sets & streaming data, and MapReduce-like
programming models.</li>
<li>Foster independent and group-based learning via a project.</li>
<li>Encourage participation and the airing of ideas: 5% of the class credit
will be for introducing oneself and having
a technical discussion during office hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tentative List of Topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis</li>
  <li>Quick recap of reductions, P and NP, NP-completeness, and other complexity classes including PSPACE, #P, and Exponential time</li>
  <li>Divide and conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Local search using more advanced examples </li>
  <li>For self-study: A quick introduction to continuous and convex optimization (gradients, convexity, optimization using Lagrange multipliers): Boyd-Vandenberghe </li>
  <li>Linear Programming (LP), duality, Matroids, Matching, and Flows</li>
  <li>Approximation algorithms, the primal-dual method, and rounding techniques; Irit Dinurâ€™s approach to the PCP Theorem and consequences of such theorems</li>
  <li>The Multiplicative Weights Update Method</li>
  <li>A brief overview of Machine Learning and continuous optimization</li>
  <li>The Sum-of-Squares paradigm</li>
  <li>SVD and other basic linear-algebraic algorithms in Data Science</li>
  <li>Online algorithms (especially in the context of Internet advertising and E-commerce)</li>
  <li>A brief look at Quantum algorithms and MapReduce</li>



</ul>



<h2>Grading, Homework, and Exams</h2>
The grading will be as follows -- students will form groups of typical size 
three for the first two items below:
<ul>
<li>Homework based on class material: 30% (your lowest HW score will be dropped) </li>
<li>Project: 15%</li>
<li>Free discussion is strongly encouraged; students will receive 5% credit
for coming to Aravind's office hours by April 15th to discuss
class-related material.</li>
<li>Take-home mid-term (dates TBA): 20%</li>
<li>In-class final exam (May 18th, 10:30-12:30): 30%</li>
</ul>



<h2>Course Evaluation</h2>
Students are strongly encouraged to complete their course evaluations toward 
the end of the semester;
please do so at the <a href = "http://www.CourseEvalUM.umd.edu">CourseEvalUM 
website</a>. 

&nbsp;<h2>Excused Absences</h2>
See the <a href = "http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/v100g.html">university's policy</a> on medically-necessitated absence from class. The
"Major Scheduled Grading Events" for this course are the mid-term and
final exams; students claiming an excused absence from these events
must apply in writing and furnish documentary support (such as from a 
health-care professional who treated
the student) for any assertion that the absence qualifies as an excused
absence. The support should explicitly indicate the dates or times the 
student was incapacitated due to illness. Self-documentation of illness 
is not itself sufficient support to excuse the absence.  An instructor 
is not under obligation to offer a substitute assignment or to give a 
student a make-up assessment unless the failure to perform was due to 
an excused absence. 

<h2>Academic Accommodations for Disabilities</h2>
  Any student eligible for and requesting reasonable academic accommodations 
  due to a disability is requested to provide, to the instructor in office 
  hours, a letter of accommodation from the Office of Disability Support 
  Services (DSS) within the first two weeks of the semester.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized 
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor Council.  
This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland for all 
undergraduate and graduate students.  As a student you are responsible 
for upholding these standards for this course.  It is very important for 
you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, 
facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of 
Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit 
<a href = "http://www.studentconduct.umd.edu">http://www.studentconduct.umd.edu</a>. <BR><BR>

To further exhibit your commitment to academic integrity, remember to 
sign the Honor Pledge on all examinations and assignments: "I pledge on 
my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance 
on this examination (assignment)."
